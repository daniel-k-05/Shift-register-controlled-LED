# Shift-register-controlled-LED
Arduino based ShiftRegister LED control

We were supposed to get a few LED's to blink.
So i figured, why not use Shift Registers.

This Project Idea came from my IT teacher. We were supposed to controll a few LED's with Arduino. I figured I could use a shift Register, but prototyping on a breadboard is annoying. So I learned how to use Autodesk EAGLE to make a custom PCB.
